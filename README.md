# Project Context

The disposal of public waste presents substantial challenges for local authorities. The recycling of used paper, glass, and textiles offers an environmentally sustainable solution that reduces the amount of rubbish sent to landfill. This project used open data to analyse public accessibility to the recycling bring sites located across Leeds, and produced visualisations that offer insights into their distribution. Literature explored throughout the study suggests this factor has marked influence over peopleâ€™s attitudes towards recycling, as such improvements to green infrastructure would be largely for public benefit. 

# Aims 

- To produce a spatial visualisation analysing bring site distribution and accessibility within a buffer zone. 
- To quantify the number of bring sites per ward and compare this to the total population 
- Explore whether a correlation exists between public demand and the amount of bring sites. 
- Highlight bring sites which are overburdened or poorly distributed to inform future recycling infrastructure policy. 

# Findings 

The spatial visualisation denoted wards of varying populations. These tended to be higher in the more central, urban areas and reduced once further removed from the city. The number of bring sites per ward appears to have little positive correlation with their total population, which may suggest current recycling sites are oversubscribed. 

# Limitations 

This project was not without its limitations, both with regards to the data available and the methods employed. 

The census data utilised was collected in 2011, whereas the recycling bring sites are from a survey from 2023. As such there is a level of uncertainty present in the findings; the problem in some wards could be exacerbated by continued population growth. 
The 1 km accessibility buffer zones created in the spatial visualisation are a Euclidean distance. A network analysis using the roads surrounding each bring site would have been more effective, but beyond the scope of this study. 
A clipped version of the Eng_wards file had to be uploaded instead of the original, due to Github Repository data limitations.
